# Guardians-of-the-Galaxy
# Game Rules:
Our game is based in space where thereâ€™s a spaceship that has two missions to accomplish. 

Game Controls:
--------------
The player uses up, down, right and left arrows to move in up, down, right and left directions respectively. And the spacebar to move forward.
As the player presses the spacebar longer, the spaceship accelerates till it reaches a maximum velocity.
If he releases his press, the spaceship decelerates till it reaches zero unless he presses spacebar again, then it will accelerate again.

Mission 1: Fuel Crisis Race
---------------------------
The spaceship must try to reach the finish line without colliding with planets, meteroids or asteroids and before the fuel runs out.  
There are fuel tanks that the spaceship can gather in order to increase its fuel supply. 
The more the spaceship accelerates, the faster its fuel run out.
Also, if the spaceship enters a blackhole, its color will change for a while and fuel will decrease.
However, if it enters a light tunnel, it will significantly speed up without any decrease in its fuel and only then it can collide with planets and asteroids without losing. 

Mission 2: Arrive on time
-------------------------
The spaceship must try to reach the finish line without colliding with planets, meteroids or asteroids within a certain time limit.  
There are gifts that the spaceship can gather in order to gain more time.
Also, if the spaceship enters a blackhole, its color will change for a while and time will decrease by 5 seconds.
However, if it enters a light tunnel, it will significantly speed up and only then it can collide with planets and asteroids without losing. 

The player loses if:
1- The spaceship collides with any of the planets, meteroids or asteroids.
2- He passes the finish line without entering it.
3- He runs out of fuel in mission 1 or runs out of time in mission 2.
